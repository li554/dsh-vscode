/**
 * Browser half of the toolcards plugin.
 *
 * The whole feature is one stylesheet: importing it is the injection. The
 * client bundler compiles `*.module.css` into an inline <style> tag stamped
 * with this plugin's id (data-plugin="@dsh-undo/client-rollback-toolcards")
 * appended at module-load time, and the loader removes the tag on unload.
 * Because every rule keys off stable data attributes the stock renderer
 * already emits, React re-renders need no observation — the cascade re-applies
 * the colors to whatever the rows remount.
